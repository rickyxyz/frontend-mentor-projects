## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Overall, I think this project is quite straightforward for me. The only hiccups I had is how to make the buttons look right and how to make the elements look good on different screen sizes.

For the buttons, I decided to make the button text transparent so it shows the background color.

```css
button {
    ...
    /* code to make the text see through */
    background-color: var(--very-light-gray);
    mix-blend-mode: screen;
    ...
}
```

Another hiccups I faced, is how to make the elements responsive. It took quite a while and a lot of experimenting to solve this. The easier solution would be to create multiple media rules to accomodate different sizes. However, I don't like that approach since I think it will make the code harder to maintain. So, I decided to use a bunch of relative units, min(), and flex-grow to solve this.

```css
/* me trying to make elements more responsive */

.card__section > h1 {
  /* ... */
  margin-top: min(50px, 15%);
  flex-grow: 1;
  /* ... */
}

.card__section > p {
  line-height: 1.6rem;
  flex-grow: 3;
}

@media screen and (max-width: 900px) {
  /* ... */
  .card__section {
    /* ... */
    padding: min(50px, 15%);
    /* ... */
  }

  .card__section p {
    flex-grow: 1;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

Until the end of this project, I am still not confident in my naming convention. I have been trying to use BEM naming convention, but still unsure.

I also still need to speed up my process of figuring out how to make element more responsive on different screen size.
