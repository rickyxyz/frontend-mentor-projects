## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first full page project. In this project I learned a lot about reusing existing CSS classes, kinda reminded me of tailwind.
It was an interesting thing to manage the CSS and adjusting individual detail.

### Continued development

After working on this project, I'm thinking of trying tailwind CSS.
