## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Typescript
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [ViteJs](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool

### What I learned

In this project, I learned more ways to perform form validations.
I also re-learned abosolutely position elements.
Using Typescript for micro/small project does not bring great benefits.

### Continued development

I hope to improve my form validation techniques, be better at using absolutely placed elements, and be more confident in using grid layout.
