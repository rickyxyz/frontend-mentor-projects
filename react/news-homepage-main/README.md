## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [ViteJs](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool

### What I learned

In this project, I learned more about how to implement a responsive layout using both grid and flexbox. Creating the layout styling took longer than expected. I also learned how to make prevent scroll when a modal is open.

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  document.body.style.overflow = isMenuOpen ? "hidden" : "auto";
}, [isMenuOpen]);
```

I just learned that adding overflow hidden keeps track of the user's current scroll position.

### Continued development

I still have a lot to learn on how to implement responsive layout that works and interactive state and animation.
