### What I learned

When I first looked at the challenge, I thought this shouldn't take too long to complete. However, I were wrong. The issue come to light pretty early, that is how to position the two circles in the background. I spent a good hour trying to figure it out, until I decided to look at how other people did this challenge. Then I saw instead of forcing the circle to stay in the corner, they just pushed the circle into the corner

```css
body {
    ...
    background: url("./images/bg-pattern-top.svg"), url("./images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg"), var(--dark-cyan);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    /* pushing the circle to the corner */
    background-position: bottom calc(50vh - 5vw) right calc(50vw + 8%), top calc(40vh + 6vw) left calc(50vw + 8%);
    ...
}
```

### Continued development

I think, I still need to work out how to structure the HTML better and improve how I name things, so they can be reused in the future.
