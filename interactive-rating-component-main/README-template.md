## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this project I learned how to use SCSS and how to do things with JavaScript without the framework. While using a framework might make my job easier, I think it is better to learn basic JS first (also, I think using framework is overkill for this project).

This is also the first time I used SCSS, so I needed to go back and forth looking at the documentation to figure some things out. From my past experience using only CSS, I can definitely see the appeal of using a preprocessor. Though I still have much to learn about preprocessor, I can say that using preprocessor made my stylesheet easier to maintain.

This project definitely took longer to finish than I would like to,x because of the learning process involved (and other real life stuff going on).

### Continued development

I would like to keep using SCSS in my future project to be proficient with it. I also would like to improve my basic JavaScript skill, so I can develop faster.

### Useful resources

- [SASS Basics](https://sass-lang.com/guide) - I started learning the basic features and how to use SCSS from this documentation page.
- [BEM and SASS:A Perfect Match](https://andrew-barnes.medium.com/bem-and-sass-a-perfect-match-5e48d9bc3894) - This article helped figure out how to use BEM naming convention in conjunction with SCSS.
