## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned or at least tried to learn how to use semantic HTML tags more often and put more focus on using relative units for this project.

### Continued development

In the future, I want to learn more on how to improve my HTML structure and class naming convetion, so people can understand my code easier.
