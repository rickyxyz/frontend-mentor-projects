## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge I practiced using CSS grids.

![grids](./screenshot/four-card-feature-section-grid.png)
The grid section for the cards.

```css
/* the code used for grid */
.wrapper {
  justify-content: center;
  justify-items: center;
  display: grid;
  gap: 3.6vh;
}

@media screen and (min-width: 1200px) {
  ... .wrapper {
    margin-top: -5vh;
    grid-template-areas: "l mt r" "l mb r";
  }
  ...;
}
```

I think the card section turned out pretty well, but there is another problem I faced, that I still couldn't solve. So, the result doesn't look so close to the design.

![flex gap problem](./screenshot/four-card-feature-section-flex-gap.png)
gap issue with flexbox

I used flexbox to separate the header and cards section, however using flexbox gap the cards section overflowed into the gap. Till the end, I couldn't figure out how to not make the cards section overflow. However, I decided to move on. Since the longer I tried the lower the return I got from this challenge.

### Continued development

I would like to revisit this challenge once more in the future, once I have learned and practiced more.
