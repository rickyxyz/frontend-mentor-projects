### What I learned

With this challenge the first thing I noticed and learned is how to use SVG to make a divider in the background.

the divider for the background

At first my approach is to make the divider as a pseudo-element of the body and then placing the element on top of the body.
But then after some tinkering, I found out I can just set the SVG as a background image and achieve the same result.

```css
/* initial approach */
body::before {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    height: 100%;
    width: 100vw;
    z-index: -1;
    background: url('./images/pattern-background-desktop.svg');
    background-repeat: repeat-x;
}
``` 

```css
/* second approach */
body {
    height: 100vh;
    
    background: url('./images/pattern-background-desktop.svg');
    background-repeat: repeat-x;
    ...
}
```

Though I do not know which one is a more sensible approach when making odd shaped dividers.

Another hiccup I encountered during this challenge is how to pad items within a div. From the design images, I think the padding on the card content changes with the device size. I thought of 2 approaches, (1) To limit the size the content can expand to or (2) use relativ units as padding.

```css
/* approach 1 */
.card__content {
    ...
    max-width: 300px;
    ...
}
```

```css
/* approach 2 */
.card__content {
    ...
    padding: 0 1.9rem;
    ...
}
```

Ultimately I decided to use the second approach, because I think it react better to different screen sizes.


### Continued development

After finishing this challenge, I think I need to find out how other people do certain stuff, like making odd-shaped divider or determining how to pad item; So, I can figure out what are the common approaches to stuff.

### Useful resources
- [SVG background section divider](https://generatepress.com/forums/topic/svg-background-section-divider/) - This post helped me figure out the initial approach to making odd shaped divider.
- [CSS Tricks non rectangular headers](https://css-tricks.com/creating-non-rectangular-headers/) - This article helped me figure out I can just use the SVG as background image on the body directly.
