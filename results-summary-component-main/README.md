## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

After not using basic HTML and CSS for a while, I realize I have not yet internalized CSS and HTML layouting in my head. I need more practice, so I can make the layout and style without strain.
