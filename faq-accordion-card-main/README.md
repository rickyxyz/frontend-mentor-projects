## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS/SCSS
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

Personally, I think the JS involved in this challenge is quite straightforward. Although, I needed to add more lines to the script because I decided to only one accordion item can be opened at a time. I think that added the extra complexity that I rather not have.

The CSS of this challenge however took quite a while to figure out how to scale the SVG images to fit screen sizes. I used a combination of clamp(), min(), and vw unit to scale the image as best as I can to the screen size.

```css
/* class for mobile */
&_illustration {
    background: url("./images/illustration-woman-online-mobile.svg") no-repeat;
    background-size: contain;
    width: 50vw;
    height: clamp(5rem, 40vw, 40rem);
    left: 50%;
    position: absolute;
    transform: translate(-50%, -58%);
}

/* class for desktop */
&_illustration {
    background: url("./images/illustration-woman-online-desktop.svg") no-repeat;
    background-size: contain;
    width: min(32vw, 38rem);
    height: min(26.6vw, 29rem);
    left: -16%;
    top: 50%;
    position: relative;
    transform: translate(0, -50%);
}
```

a part of the CSS used for scaling the image.

### Continued development

Looking at my SCSS again, I think I could make it better using mixins. However, I am not sure yet how to use mixin in SCSS. I am also pretty sure my JS code could be streamlined, however I don't know how yet.
