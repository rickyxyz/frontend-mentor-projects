## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Thus far, this is the most convoluted project I have made in terms of CSS styling. At first, since I wanted to learn grid in CSS I tried to build this using grids. However, due to lack of knowledge the result isn't really responsive. So, I tried using a combination of grids and flexboxes to make the website more responsive in my second attempt.

On my second attempt, I tried to build the challenge in mobile layout first and then added the css for desktop sizes. I found this approach is easier for this challenge (or maybe mobile-first approach makes development easier in general). This is the first challenge that I approach using a mobile-first thinking.

### Continued development

Firstly, I would like to be better at CSS grids. I don't know how many times I needed to look at CSS grid reference during this challenge. Secondly, I would like to try more problems with a mobile-first approach, since it might make the development process easier.

### Useful resources
