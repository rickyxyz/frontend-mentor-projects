## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While this project is not techincally complex, it is quite a challenge to keep the code readable. For larger project, putting everything in one file is getting unmanagable. I think my limit is around 400 - 600 lines of code in one CSS file.

### Continued development

In the future, I hope to learn more ways to orgranize my CSS and HTML structure. Putting all the HTML and CSS for this scale is getting hard to manage.
