## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I find that using opacity for hover effect makes it difficult to have different element with different opacity on hover. So, instead I used color with transperancy to control the opacity of different element within one hover event. 

```css
    .thumbnail-container:hover .thumbnail-hover, .thumbnail-container:active .thumbnail-hover{
    background-color: var(--cyan-hover);
}
```
I used the code above instead of the code below
```css
.thumbnail-container:hover .thumbnail-hover, .thumbnail-container:active .thumbnail-hover{
    opacity: 0.6;
}
```

Additionally, I learned that to make color transition effect works with svg path, you need to assign it a base value first.

```css
.thumbnail-hover path {
    fill: var(--transparent); /* I need this color so the transition will work*/
    transition: fill 0.5s ease;
}
```

### Continued development

From this project, I think I still need to learn how to use semantic tags and relative units (rem, em, ...). In this project I feel like I didn't pay enough attention semantic tags and mostly used exact units like pixels instead.

### Useful resources

- [Hover Effect](https://codepen.io/nxworld/pen/ZYNOBZ) - This helped me for making the hover effect for image.
- [SVG Hover](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20012240/using-css-to-transition-the-fill-property-of-an-svg-path-on-hover) - From this thread I learned to add starting fill color to path in order to make transition work properly.
